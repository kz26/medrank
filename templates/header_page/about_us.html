<p>The purpose of this website is to compile medicare data<sup>1</sup> given to the population, to analyze the data, and to present the data in an ethical standpoint to assist the general population with their hospital decision-making. We have chosen six factors to “grade” the hospitals in regards to their patient care. These factors are weighted as follows:

<p>
Each of these individual factors can be graded from 0-100%. Once they are properly weighted and summed up, a hospital with a total grade of greater than or equal to 80% would be indicated with a smiley face, a grade of between 60-80% would be indicated with a neutral face, and a grade of lower than 60% would be indicated with an “ill” face in the rankings. On the map, a hospital with a total grade of greater than or equal to 80% would be presented with a green marker, a grade between 60-80% would be presented with a yellow marker, and a grade of under 60% would be presented with a red marker.
<p>
Survival and Non-readmissions
Therefore, a high hospital overall score indicates a better hospital, in regards to these standards. We chose survival rate and non-readmissions to be the highest indicating factor because these factors are essential to physician-based care. Ethically, having a strong survival rate is acting towards providing beneficence in the medical care, as physicians principally must do good to their patients. Non-readmissions would address the patient autonomy and nonmaleficence aspect of ethical health care. For example, patients (who are too sick to go home) may want to be discharged from the ER. However, physicians must negotiate with patients to prevent the patients from any possible complications of their disease (nonmaleficence), ultimately preventing the patient of a hospital readmittance. Thus, there is a battle between respecting patient autonomy and acting in nonmaleficence that physicians must face, and the hospitals with the highest non-readmittance rate would prove to do well in this factor.
<p>
Medicare hospital spending per patient
Medicare hospital spending per patient was the next highest category because it is central to the availability and accessibility of health care.  In our research we determined that higher hospital spending was linked to lower mortality and lower readmission rates.<sup>3</sup>  Increasing spending meant more specialist visits, higher nurse to patient ratios, preoperative specialty care, and postdischarge collaborative care, and interventional and medical care.<sup>3</sup>  Distributive justice comes into play with regards to how hospital spending differs between hospitals.  Since higher spending leads to better patient outcomes, physicians need to consider the ethical principle of distributive justice in their care.  Physicians on an individual practice level and on an administrative, societal level need to decide which patients will get the more expensive care.  Since higher spending leads to better care, physicians need to distribute funds equally amongst their patients for similar cases.
<p>
Patients without serious complications
We gave serious complications a medium ranking because we feel that it is more important to focus on the direct care of the patient’s illness than the potential side effects. It is important to monitor the complications of procedures so that the patient care can be maximized.  The physicians need to consider nonmaleficence with respect to performing procedures.  Side effects are sometimes unavoidable, (i.e. side effects of a medication occur even when dosage is properly followed by the patient) but physicians can work to reduce the number of complications from surgeries and medications (i.e. accidental cuts and tears form medical treatments, wounds re-opening after poor stitching, etc.).
<p>
Patients who were seen at the hospital in a timely manner
Patients who were seen in a timely manner
This factor can be defined as the percentage of patients who did not leave due to long waiting times, and were seen by a physician. We gave this factor a lower ranking because we feel that it is more important to provide care to the patients already admitted (increase survivability and non-readmission) than it is to admit waiting patients.
<p>
This is a conflict between providing beneficence and distributive justice; physicians have to balance between providing care to the patients already admitted while also making time to ensure that all patients can receive care. The hospitals with the highest percentage of patients seen in a timely manner would be efficiently managing this ethical dilemma.
<p>
Patient satisfaction
We gave patient satisfaction a lower ranking because it was not directly implicated in the health of a patient.  Patient satisfaction is an important facet of patient care but it is not as important as the direct medical improvement of the patient.  Furthermore, in our research, higher patient satisfaction was linked to higher mortality.<sup>2</sup>  At times patients ask for procedures that are not ideal for their health.  In these cases, the physician faces the struggle of respecting patient autonomy and doing what is medically best for the patient by convincing the patient to do a different procedure (beneficence).
